## How Functions Work Normally

Before diving into closures, let's understand how functions normally work in JavaScript:

```javascript
function sayHello(name) {
    var greeting = "Hello " + name;
    return greeting;
}

console.log(sayHello("John")); // "Hello John"
```

**What happens when this function is called:**

1. **JavaScript creates an execution context** - a container for this function
2. **Inside this container:**
   - Parameter `name` with value "John"
   - Variable `greeting` with value "Hello John"
3. **Function executes and returns the value**
4. **Execution context is destroyed** - all variables disappear from memory

This is normal behavior. Once the function finishes, everything inside it is gone.

---

## Nested Functions

Now, what happens when we have a function inside another function?

```javascript
function outerFunction(x) {
    console.log("I'm in outer function, x =", x);
    
    function innerFunction(y) {
        console.log("I'm in inner function, y =", y);
        console.log("But I can also see x =", x); // 🎯 This is the magic!
        return x + y;
    }
    
    return innerFunction;
}
```

Notice how the `innerFunction` can access the variable `x` from the `outerFunction`. This is where closures begin!

## Execution Contexts Breakdown

Let's trace through what happens in memory step by step:

```javascript
var result = outerFunction(10);
console.log(result(5)); // 15
```

### Step 1: When `outerFunction(10)` is called

```
EXECUTION CONTEXT STACK:

[Global Execution Context]
├── result: undefined (will be assigned later)

[Outer Function Execution Context] ← Currently executing
├── x: 10
├── innerFunction: [Function definition]
```

### Step 2: When `outerFunction` returns `innerFunction`

```
EXECUTION CONTEXT STACK:

[Global Execution Context]
├── result: [innerFunction] ← Now assigned

[Outer Function Execution Context] ← Should be destroyed... BUT WAIT! 🛑
├── x: 10 ← This stays alive because innerFunction needs it!
```

### Step 3: When we call `result(5)` - which is actually `innerFunction(5)`

```
EXECUTION CONTEXT STACK:

[Global Execution Context]
├── result: [innerFunction]

[Outer Function Context] ← Still alive! 🎉
├── x: 10 ← innerFunction can still access this

[Inner Function Execution Context] ← Currently executing
├── y: 5
├── Can access x from outer context: 10
├── Returns: 15 (x + y = 10 + 5)
```

**🔥 Key Insight:** Even though the outer function finished executing, its variable `x` stayed alive because the inner function still needs it. This is a **CLOSURE**!

---

## What is a Closure?

> **A closure is when an inner function 'closes over' variables from its outer function, keeping them alive even after the outer function has finished executing.**

### Simple Example

```javascript
function createGreeting(greeting) {
    // This variable will be 'captured' by the closure
    var message = greeting;
    
    // This inner function 'closes over' the message variable
    function greet(name) {
        return message + " " + name;
    }
    
    return greet;
}

var sayHello = createGreeting("Hello");
var sayGoodbye = createGreeting("Goodbye");

console.log(sayHello("John"));    // "Hello John"
console.log(sayGoodbye("Jane"));  // "Goodbye Jane"
```

### Execution Context Analysis

**When `createGreeting("Hello")` is called:**
```
[createGreeting Context]
├── greeting: "Hello"
├── message: "Hello"
├── greet: [Function] ← This function remembers 'message'
```

**After `createGreeting` returns:**
```
[sayHello closure] 🔐
├── message: "Hello" ← Captured from createGreeting
├── greet function code

[sayGoodbye closure] 🔐
├── message: "Goodbye" ← Captured from createGreeting  
├── greet function code
```

**Important:** Each closure has its own independent copy of the variables!

## Multiple Nested Functions

What happens with function returning function returning function?

```javascript
function level1(a) {
    console.log("Level 1: a =", a);
    
    function level2(b) {
        console.log("Level 2: b =", b, "a =", a);
        
        function level3(c) {
            console.log("Level 3: c =", c, "b =", b, "a =", a);
            return a + b + c;
        }
        
        return level3;
    }
    
    return level2;
}

var step1 = level1(10);      // Returns level2 function
var step2 = step1(20);       // Returns level3 function  
var result = step2(30);      // Returns 60
```

### Tracing Through Execution Contexts

#### Step 1: `level1(10)` is called
```
[Level1 Execution Context]
├── a: 10
├── level2: [Function definition]
```

#### Step 2: `level1` returns, but context stays alive
```
[Level1 Context - CLOSURE] 🔐
├── a: 10 ← level2 needs this

[step1 variable]
├── Points to level2 function
├── level2 has access to 'a' through closure
```

#### Step 3: `step1(20)` calls `level2(20)`
```
[Level1 Context - CLOSURE] 🔐
├── a: 10 ← Still alive

[Level2 Execution Context]
├── b: 20
├── level3: [Function definition]
├── Can access 'a' from Level1 context ✅
```

#### Step 4: `level2` returns, creating another closure
```
[Level1 Context - CLOSURE] 🔐
├── a: 10 ← Still needed

[Level2 Context - CLOSURE] 🔐
├── b: 20 ← level3 needs this

[step2 variable]
├── Points to level3 function
├── level3 has access to both 'a' and 'b' through closure chain
```

#### Step 5: `step2(30)` calls `level3(30)`
```
[Level1 Context - CLOSURE] 🔐
├── a: 10 ← Still alive

[Level2 Context - CLOSURE] 🔐
├── b: 20 ← Still alive

[Level3 Execution Context] 
├── c: 30
├── Can access 'b' from Level2 context ✅
├── Can access 'a' from Level1 context ✅
├── Returns: a + b + c = 10 + 20 + 30 = 60
```

**🌟 Amazing Result:** The `level3` function has access to variables from **ALL** outer functions through the closure chain!

## Key Takeaways

1. **Closures preserve scope** - Inner functions remember outer variables
2. **Execution contexts stay alive** - If needed by inner functions
3. **Each closure is independent** - Has its own copy of variables
4. **Closure chains exist** - Multiple levels of nesting create chains
5. **Memory implications** - Variables in closures stay in memory

## Try It Yourself

Test your understanding with this example:

```javascript
function mystery(x) {
    function inner(y) {
        return x * y;
    }
    x = x + 1;
    return inner;
}

var func = mystery(5);
console.log(func(3)); // What will this print? 🤔
```

<summary>Click to see the answer</summary>

**Answer: 18**

Explanation:
- `mystery(5)` is called with `x = 5`
- `x` is incremented to `6` 
- `inner` function is returned with closure over `x = 6`
- `func(3)` calls `inner(3)` which returns `6 * 3 = 18`
